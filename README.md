# My Personal Website built in Elm

## ... but why?
So I heard functional programming... and I heard frontend. As I'm no fan of either, I decided that it was a proper challenge to make myself a personal website.

Expect weird, non-idiomatic solutions and whatever problems I might run into!

## Running it

```
elm package install
elm reactor -a localhost
```
